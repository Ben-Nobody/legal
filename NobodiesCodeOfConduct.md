**Nobodies Collective Association Code of Conduct**
===================================================

**1\. Purpose of this Code**
----------------------------

This Code of Conduct sets out the standards of behaviour expected of all individuals involved in the **The Nobodies Collective Association** (hereafter referred to as the **Association**). It exists to ensure that the Association remains a **safe, respectful, inclusive, and legally compliant environment** for all participants, members, collaborators, volunteers, and guests.

By participating in any **Association Event**, holding any **Association role**, or engaging with the Association in any capacity, individuals agree to comply with this Code.

This Code operates alongside the Association’s **Statutes**, internal policies, and applicable law. In the event of inconsistency, the Statutes and Spanish law shall prevail.

**2\. Scope of Application**
----------------------------

This Code applies **at all times**, including but not limited to:

*   During **Association Events**, including preparation, set-up, operation, and dismantling
    
*   At **meetings, assemblies, workshops, and gatherings** organised by the Association (in-person or online)
    
*   In **year-round Association activities**, including working groups and committees
    
*   In **communications between Association members, collaborators, or volunteers**, including email, messaging platforms, and online collaboration tools
    
*   On **official Association communication channels**, including social media
    
*   In conduct that materially affects the functioning, reputation, or safety of the Association
    

**3\. Community Standards**
---------------------------

All persons covered by this Code are expected to uphold the following principles:

### **3.1 Respectful Interaction**

Treat all individuals with dignity and respect. Make reasonable efforts to understand differences in culture, language, background, opinion, and motivation. Harassment, hostility, or exclusionary behaviour is not acceptable.

### **3.2 Communication and Collaboration**

The Association operates across multiple languages and contexts. Participants are expected to communicate in inclusive, constructive ways and to collaborate in good faith.

### **3.3 Mutual Care**

Association activities can be emotionally and physically demanding. Participants are encouraged to look out for one another and to offer appropriate support when someone appears in difficulty.

### **3.4 Personal Responsibility**

Individuals are responsible for their own wellbeing. This includes recognising limits, communicating boundaries, respecting the boundaries of others, and seeking help when needed.

### **3.5 Care for Shared Spaces and Resources**

Participants are expected to act responsibly with respect to shared spaces, environments, materials, and resources, and to minimise waste and harm.

**4\. Prohibited Conduct**
--------------------------

The Association will not tolerate the following behaviours:

*   Verbal abuse, intimidation, bullying, harassment, or name-calling
    
*   Physical violence, threats, or aggressive behaviour
    
*   Threats of harm to oneself or others
    
*   Discrimination or harassment based on sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion or belief, disability, age, or any other protected characteristic
    
*   Sexual harassment, unwelcome sexual attention, or unwanted physical contact
    
*   Sexual activity in public or shared spaces not explicitly designated for such activity
    
*   Non-consensual photography, filming, or sharing of images or recordings
    
*   Use of drones or surveillance equipment without explicit authorisation
    
*   Bringing animals to Association Events except authorised assistance animals with prior written approval
    
*   Repeated or serious disregard for Association policies (including sound, safety, or operational rules)
    
*   Behaviour that wastes excessive resources, obstructs volunteers or organisers, or places the Association or its events at risk
    
*   Any illegal activity
    

**5\. Consent**
---------------

### **5.1 Definition**

Consent is a **voluntary, informed, and specific agreement** between people to engage in a particular activity.

The Association treats breaches of consent as **serious misconduct**.

### **5.2 Consent Applies To**

Consent is required for, among other things:

*   Physical contact (sexual or non-sexual)
    
*   Sexual activity or consensual violence, particularly where others may witness it
    
*   Entering private or semi-private spaces
    
*   Borrowing or using personal or camp property
    
*   Gifting (recipients must know what they are accepting)
    
*   Taking or sharing photographs or recordings
    
*   Allocation of responsibilities, tasks, or roles that materially affect others
    

### **5.3 Valid Consent Must Be**

*   **Freely given** – not coerced, pressured, or conditional
    
*   **Informed** – all parties understand what is proposed
    
*   **Reversible** – can be withdrawn at any time without justification
    
*   **Enthusiastic** – absence of a clear “yes” must be treated as a “no”
    
*   **Specific** – consent for one activity does not imply consent for others
    

**6\. Raising Concerns**
------------------------

Any person who experiences or witnesses behaviour contrary to this Code is encouraged to raise a concern.

Reports may be made through appropriate Association channels depending on context, including:

*   Designated event welfare or consent roles (during Association Events)
    
*   Relevant working-group leads or coordinators
    
*   The Board of Trustees or persons delegated by it
    
*   Moderators of official Association communication channels
    
*   Confidential reporting mechanisms established by the Association
    

Reports relating to consent may be escalated to a dedicated **Consent or Disciplinary process**, where applicable.

**7\. Handling of Complaints and Consequences**
-----------------------------------------------

All reports will be handled:

*   **Confidentially**
    
*   **Impartially**
    
*   **Proportionately**
    
*   **In a timely manner**
    

Possible responses include, depending on severity and context:

*   Informal resolution or mediation
    
*   Warnings or behavioural agreements
    
*   Reassignment or suspension of roles or responsibilities
    
*   Temporary or permanent exclusion from Association Events
    
*   Initiation of a formal disciplinary process under the Association’s Statutes, which may result in sanctions up to and including removal from the Association
    

Serious incidents may be referred to external authorities where legally required.

**8\. Confidentiality and Language**
------------------------------------

All Code of Conduct matters are confidential and must be handled with discretion.

In the event of any discrepancy between language versions of this Code, the **Spanish version shall prevail**.

**9\. A Shared Responsibility**
-------------------------------

This Code is not merely punitive. It is a shared commitment to maintaining a community and organisation grounded in respect, responsibility, consent, and care.

All members and participants are expected to actively uphold both the **letter and the spirit** of this Code.
